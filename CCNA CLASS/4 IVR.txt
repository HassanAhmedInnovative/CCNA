-By default different vlan directly can't communicate with each other.
-To communicate between different vlans there should be routing, 
 requres layer 3 devices
Def:- inter vlan routing makes communication between multiple vlans.

Types of inter vlan routing:-

1 ivr using standard gateway:-

2 ivr using subinterfaces:-

3 ivr using layer 3 switch:-

IVR using standard gateway:-
	-Single gateway / Router is used to establish communication between 2 vlans

IVR using subinterfaces:-
	-using subinterface we create multiple interfaces for vlans and define 
        encapsulation dot1q for vlans to communicate each other.
