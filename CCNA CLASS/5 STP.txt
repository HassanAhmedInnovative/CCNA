		stp:spanning tree protcol
stp is open standard protocol IEEE 802
stp is enabled by default in all catalysts swithces.
when ever there is redundancy connection, stp enabled switches
can't understand that makes loop in the network.
Every switch sends bpdu (bridge protocol data unit), try to understand
that there is loop network, tries over come loop.
How to over the come loop :-
1 selecting the root bridge
2 seleting the root port
3 selecting designated port(fwd) & non designated port(blocked port)
**The root Bridge**
- the bridge with lowest bridge id
	Bridge id - priority+mac address of the switch
	Root bridge will interface in fwd state
**Selecting the root port**
	It is shortest root bridge to reach
		1 least cost
		2 the lowest forwarding  upstream root bridge id
		3 lowest forwarding upstream port number
**designated & non designated
  		1 least cost
		2 the lowest bridge id

stp port states
listening  - 15 sec
learning     - 15 sec
forwarding  - no limit
disable      - no limit
blocking   -  20 seconds

how to make non root bridge switch as root bridge

#spanning-tree vlan 1 root primary
#spanning-tree vlan 1 priority 4096
