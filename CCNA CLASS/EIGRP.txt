
	**** EIGRP - Enahanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol****

- It is cisco proprietary until 2013; but now standardised
-It is distance vector dynamic routing protocol
-It uses diffusing update alogarithm
-Eigrp advertises routes with in the same Autonomous systems
	supports 1-65535
-Maximum hops supported are 255
-metric = Bw+load+Delay+MTU+Reliability
-Does incremental updates, does not do perdicall updates.
-Administrative distance for eigrp routes are 90
- EIGRP packets:-
	-Hello
	-Update
	-Ack
	-query
	-reply
-Eigrp tables:-
	- eigrp neighbor  - Show ip eigrp neighbor
	- Eigrp topology  - show ip eigrp topology
	- Eigrp routes    -show ip route eigrp
