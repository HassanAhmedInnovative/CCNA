		OSPF-open shortest path first

Documentation:- ospf anatomy - john T.moy 
What is ospf:-
	open standard based interior gateway routing protocol
	link state routing protcol :
		link -physical connection device
		state:- it description to neighbor
	uses spf (or) diskstra alogaritham
	metric-cost=(10*8/bandwidth)
	unlimited hops
	incremental updates
	hello-10sec,dead 40
	administrative distance 110
	load balancing only on equl cost 
	support flsm /vlsm

Ospf requires more planing becacuse of it's heirarchial designing of areas.
You must create a area 0; which is central area or main area.

*ospf router types:-
1 Backbone router - configured only area 0/ core router / redundancy 
2 ABR - area border router -Connects other areas to area 0
3 INTERNAL routers -router configued only in one area  (ie area 1)
4 ASBR- advertizes external routes
5 DR - designated router
6 BDR- backup designated router

OSPF neighbor states:
1 Down state : no hellos have been heard from the neighbor's router
2 Attempt
3 init - indicates a hello packet has been heard from the neighbor,
4 2-way
5 exstart
6 exchange
7 loading
8 full  




****LSA types****

1  - router lsa
2  - network lsas
3 & 4 summary lsas
5 autonomous system
	external lsas
6 multicast ospf lsa
7 defined for not-so-stubby areas
8 external attributes lsa for 
   border gateway protocol
9,10,11 Opaque lsas
