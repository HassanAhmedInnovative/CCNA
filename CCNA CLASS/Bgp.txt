	***BGP - Border gateway protocol****

-Igp's opearate within the single AS
-Bgp is used between autonamous systems.
-open standard
-Exterior gateway protocol
-Designed for inter-as domain routing
-Classless
-Updates are incremental
-path vector protocol

*-it sends updates manually defined neighbor as unicast
* Bgp is application layer protocol uses tcp  for relilibility (TCP port 179)
*metric - attributes
Administrative distance
	20 - external updates
	200 - internal updates
-Exchange of loop-free routing information is guaranteed.
-path vector protocol includes information about exact path
-BGP routes are controlled by bgp attibutes

BGP packets

open - (hello packet) + 60S 
keepalive -  180S
update - routes are exchanging by router
notification- close the seesion

BGP tables:-
1 Neighbor table
	ibgp peers - bgp neighbors within the same AS
	ebgp peers - bgp neighbors connecting different AS
2 Routing table
