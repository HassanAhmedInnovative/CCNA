
		Traditional router based networks:-
Leased line connection:-
Advantages:- complete secure, high bandwidth, superior quality, Reliable
Disadvantages:-expensive,not scalable,

Vpn:- Establish a private network on existing public network. 
          vpn completely replaces point to point connection.
Eg:-x.25, Atm, frame relay, GRE, DMVPN, IPSec,Mpls, L2tpv3
Advantages:- cost savings, scalability, improved security,Reliable,flexiable
	
vpn over internet:-
GRE:- generic routing encapsulation, is tunneling protocol developed by cisco  	gre does not encrypt the data but encapsulates
	it is point to point
	max= 99
	        
DMVPN:- point to multipoint, No encryption
	
Ipsec:- Encryption is provided, both ends must have registerd public ip


DMVPN:-
Introduced by cisco in late 2000
-automatically created vpn tunnels with dynamic ip addrss on the spokes are in use
-this is pure hub & spoke technology
-dmvpn combination of fallowing technologies
	-Mgre
	-NHRP - next hop resolution protocol
	-Dynamic routing protocol
